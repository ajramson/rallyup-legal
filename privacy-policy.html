    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We use the following third-party services to provide our app functionality:</p>

        <li><strong>Apple (StoreKit):</strong> To process in-app purchases and subscriptions. Payment information is handled entirely by Apple.</li>

    <h2>Data Storage</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Saved speeches are stored locally on your device only.</li>
        <li><strong>No Cloud Sync:</strong> We do not sync your data across devices or store it on external servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporary Processing:</strong> Audio files are temporarily stored during generation and delivered to your device, then deleted from our servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not retain your personal data. The device identifier is stored locally on your device and can be reset by reinstalling the app.</p>
